| Overhaul Websocket header sent be server.
|	- Dynamically read origin from client so that anyone may connect to the web socket.
|		=>	Possibly load from a list in the code or text file to determine who is and is
|		 		not allowed?
|	- Figure out what punycode encoding is (apparently Host must be sent to client this
|		way.)
|	- Need to determine what /resource name/ should be. Currently everything works 
|		without this field.

- Fix streaming connection loss error when client disconnects.
