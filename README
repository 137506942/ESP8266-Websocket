This library indends to provide the arduino with the ability to act as a websocket server.
At the moment it is not fully working and has some annoying bugs which will be ironed out 
in the future. Please feel free to submit bugs, send me any suggestions of requests or even 
fix bugs :P

== HOW DO I USE THIS?
*** Before you do anything you might want to take websocket.html uot of this
folder and put it on your desktop/somewhere else. ***

Once websocket.html is out, drag this directory to your (Arduino)/libraries 
directory and drop it (you will have to restart the arduino IDE to see the 
library in the menu).

Check out the examples to see how the arduino behaves. To 
actually access the websocket, you'll need the latest Google Chrome and the 
websocket.html. Load this HTML file up in your browser after compiling and 
installing the websocket demo on your arduino.
